Overview

This project delves into the fascinating realm of the Italian game, a linguistic challenge where a target word or phrase links multiple clues. Our approach harnesses a variety of phrases and sentences from diverse sources, focusing on extracting nouns to solve the game. We employed multiple novel algorithms and transformer models, achieving rudimentary success in this complex task.

Key Targets

Machine Learning: Applying ML techniques to understand and predict the structure of language in the context of the game.

Classification: Categorizing text data based on the target words or phrases.

Neural Networks: Utilizing neural networks to model and solve the game's linguistic patterns.

Data Analysis: Analyzing text data to extract meaningful patterns and insights.

Feature Engineering: Crafting and selecting relevant features from text data to improve model performance.

Data Visualization: Presenting findings and insights through visual representations to better understand the data and model performance.

Key Libraries

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Plotly: For creating interactive data visualizations.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For processing and analyzing human language data.

Skip-Gram Classification: For predicting context words from target words in language modeling.

WordNet: For semantic analysis and similarity checking in texts.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): For modeling sequential data and temporal patterns in language.

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN used for long-term dependency modeling in sequences.

Bidirectional Auto Regressive Transformer (BART): For understanding and generating text using transformer architecture.

T5 Architecture: For text-to-text tasks, transforming all NLP problems into a text-to-text format.

Sentence Transformer: For efficient sentence embedding generation.

GPT-2: For generative text tasks and advanced natural language understanding.

Programming Language

Python: The primary programming language used for the project, favored for its extensive libraries and support in machine learning and data analysis tasks.
